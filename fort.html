                    Fort that is about 22 km from Gokarna. The huge fort is said to have been built in the 16th
                    century, close to the Mirjan Port which was used in the ancient times to export pepper,
                    saltpetre and nutmeg. The fort that stands in the bend of a creek in the Aghanashini River,
                    is truly well worth a visit. The green landscape surrounding it is a exceptionally quiet and
                    the rumble of the water beside provides with the natural noise to lighten up the place.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>There are many versions to the dating of this fort.
                    The first historical vision the Mirjan Fort was built initially by a Nawayath as per Ibn_Battuta
                    book
                    this fort was first built by Nawayath Sultanates early 1200, then it came under the Vijayanagara
                    Empire. Then the fort was refurbished in 1608 [Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)] refers to its
                    building over a period of 1608-1640) on the south east coastal part of the Tadri Creek.

                    Another version that is traced to the period 1552-1606 is that the Mirjan Fort was built initially
                    by Queen Chennabhairadevi. She was from the Tuluva-Saluva clan and ruled for a long period (for 54
                    years) under the protection of the Vijayanagara Empire (the queen preferred to be subordinate
                    (mahamandaleshwara) of Vijayanagar rulers), as the queen of Gersoppa (a small town on the northern
                    banks of the Sharavati River). She was given the epithet "The Pepper Queen or Raina Da Pimenta'.She
                    devoutly practiced Jainism and during her rule constructed many Jain basadis. She ruled "in
                    conformity with the doctrine of succession Aliyasantana or Matriarchal, a tradition followed in
                    coastal belt of Konkan and Kerala". Her domain covered North and South Kanara districts and south
                    Goa, which had important ports such as Malpe, Bidnoor, Mirjan, Honnavar, Ankola and Karwar from
                    where the pepper, the most important produce of the region, was shipped to Europe. However, she
                    suffered reverses after the Talikota war in which the Vijayanagar Empire was routed. She then
                    shifted from Mirjan Fort to a safe location in an island in the middle of the Sharavathi River.</p>
                <h2>Architecture of Mirjan Fort</h2>
                <p>The fort is constructed across a 10-acre area using locally accessible laterite stones. It has an
                    Indianized style of architecture but is greatly influenced by Portuguese and Islamic culture. The
                    Mirjan Fort in Gokarna is one of the most beautiful tourist spots in Karnataka. The fort has endured
                    the most ferocious conflicts and held out under siege with several wells dug to store water for use
                    during the war and beyond.

                    It was among the most impregnable forts because of its thick walls, watchtowers, and bastions. Four
                    entrances, 1 main and 3 subsidiaries, and multiple interconnected wells and access routes leading to
                    the circular moat were most likely utilized as a defense mechanism to protect the fort. The fort is
                    surrounded by a moat that connects to the canals. It has exit gates used by the residents to enable
                    a quick escape during an enemy attack.

                    Today, the fort lies in ruins because of the innumerable fights it has witnessed over its lifetime.
                    With a reasonable number of repairs carried out by the ASI, you can now see a completely renovated
                    northernmost bastion defense system. The renovation was carried out by the stones located in the
                    vicinity.</p>

                <p>Mirjan Fort has a long and illustrious history, with several interpretations of its origins.

                    According to one legend, the fort was erected in the 16th century by the Tuluva-Saluva clan's Pepper
                    Queen, Chennabhairav Devi. She was the Queen of Gersoppa, a Vijayanagar area and her reign was one
                    of the longest in the subcontinent, lasting nearly 54 years. Her stronghold was in the North and
                    South Kannada and South Goa districts.

                    She moved her power base from Mirjan to a secure place on an island in the middle of the Sharavathi
                    Riverbed after the battle of Tallikota in 1565, when Bijapur Sultans besieged the areas. She then
                    converted to Jainism and constructed many Jain Temples. The fort was taken over by the Marathas in
                    1757 and then by the British in 1784.

                    According to one account, the fort was built around 1200 A.D. by the Nawayath Sultanates and was
                    later acquired by the Vijayanagara Empire.

                    Another account of the fort's history claims that it was erected by a Bijapur nobleman named
                    Sherif-ul-Mulk to guard the city of Kumta and the Kumta fort, which is situated south.

                    Another story claims that the Vijayanagara Empire ruled Mirjan fort.

                    When the kingdom fell apart, the Bijapur Sultans took control, and Sharief-ul-Mulk, the former
                    governor of Goa, restored it to his liking. The Kela dead dynasty's queen Chennamma occupied this
                    province in 1676. The Marathas conquered the fort in 1757, taking full advantage of a local
                    uprising, and the British government Major Torriano seized it in 1784.

                    Now that's quite a bit of history to absorb and hold. But a visit to the Mirjan Fort in Gokarna will
                    bring it all together perfectly well.</p>
                <h2>Best time to visit Mirjan Fort in Gokarna:</h2>
                <p>The Mirjan Fort in Gokarna is an excellent vacation spot all year round. You can enjoy this place the
                    best after monsoons with gorgeous grasslands and humongous stone formations.

                    September to February is ideal for visiting Mirjan Fort. While you may experience sporadic showers
                    now and then, they will not spoil your visit. If you are not too fond of monsoons, we advise you to
                    tour the place during winters, i.e., November to February.

                    Since it is a coastal area, summers are hot and humid and mostly not the right time to visit the
                    fort.</p>
