                    <p>The lovely Half-Moon beach is the third beach in Gokarna's coastal belt. The beach is roughly
                        63.8 kilometres from Karwar and only a few kilometres from Gokarna's major city. It is separated
                        from Om Beach by a hill from where visitors may enjoy a spectacular view of the sea.

                        Several village cottages in the typical Indian architecture can be seen lined up along the
                        shore, giving it a pretty traditional and cosy feel. The gorgeous beach is ideal for unwinding
                        and chilling out amid the big blue seas and the soft sand, staring at the caverns and the

                        <p>Swimming in the cool waters of the Half Moon beach is among the most exhilarating feelings.
                            All you can see ahead of you is the boundless ocean and behind you is the dense forest,
                            making you feel like you're the last surviving person on the planet.

                            Diving, kayaking, paddling boaters, paintball and camping are just a few of the wonderful
                            activities available.

                            The cuisine served in the shack eateries is delicious to add more to the list. Half Moon
                            Beach, which overlooks the whole coastline of Om Beach, is undoubtedly a vacation place for
                            wanderlusts looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life and waiting to dive into
                            nature's lap.

                            Water activities, on the other hand, are not available. Lying on the beach in the daytime
                            and laying in hammocks at night are other ways for visitors to relax.</p>
                        <h2>Trekking to the Half Moon Beach</h2>
                        <p>The journey to Half-Moon beach starts at Om Beach. First, proceed to the southern end of Om
                            Beach and up the small route that runs straight to the Dolphin Café. A whiteboard outside
                            the café marks the spot of the Half Moon beach and points in its direction.

                            You can spot a hiking trail junction a few minutes into the hike. You will see woody and
                            prickly shrubs along this small trekking trail along the coast. On the left-hand side of the
                            route are hills, and on the right-hand side is a beautiful blue sea.

                            The winding trekking trail leads you to a five-minute hike through the forest. It will take
                            you around four to five minutes to walk around the hillside and a few more minutes till you
                            reach the Half Moon beach.</p>
