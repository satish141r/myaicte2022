                <p>As evidenced in part by its façade, Kahani Paradise is both luxurious and understated. Its
                    colonnaded, pan-Asian architecture borrows loosely from Keralan, southern Indian and Thai styles.
                    The loving tribute to India continues indoors, with artful arches, hints of jaali work and several
                    objects’ d’art, sculptures and other antiques sourced from across the country, punctuating the
                    décor.

                    Imposing antique doors guard each of its six, airy guest rooms, which offer stunning views of the
                    surrounding greenery and the sea. “Every corner, every little piece of the house is completely
                    bespoke and designed for our family. And that’s one of the reasons why it’s so popular as a hotel,
                    because people arrive here and they feel at home. Everything is so well-considered and built to the
                    highest European standards in terms of the material we have used and how everything works,” explains
                    Bellm. </p>

                <p>What sets Kahani Paradise apart from a regular homestay is that it marries the exclusivity and
                    creature comforts of a boutique luxury hotel with the warmth of a home. The property comes fully
                    staffed, many of whom are locals. An in-house chef will treat you to local cuisine, but will also
                    whip up Italian, Mediterranean, Thai or Sri Lankan should you find yourself in the mood. The
                    property may be a short distance from Paradise Beach, one of the quieter of Gokarna’s beaches, but
                    it might as well be miles away from the town altogether. Spread across 20 acres, the grounds warrant
                    their own map.

                    Besides the main villa, there are three pavilions, one of which houses a spa; an infinity pool; a
                    temple; a farmhouse; a cricket pitch (which doubles as a helipad); a tennis court; and a meditation
                    space. The lush landscaped gardens are as well-considered as the house itself. Filled with as many
                    as 3,500 varieties of flora, they’re a tribute to the villa’s location in the Western Ghats, one of
                    the most biodiverse places in the world. The best way to take it all in is on a stroll with a local
                    guide. There’s also a vintage jeep and Enfield motorbikes to amuse yourself with</p>

                <p>The Konkani villas at SwaSwara are nothing short of art that has come to life! They are named so as
                    they were constructed in true Konkani style – laterite walls, wooden pillars, coconut thatched
                    roofs, and a lovely open-air bathroom! The Spirit of Life is truly embraced in the architecture all
                    over the retreat. The retreat has 24 beautiful villas that have been constructed using natural
                    materials and are very eco-friendly.
                    As you enter, you will see a storage section on the right and the bathroom next to it. On the left,
                    is the air-conditioned bedroom that has a cupboard along with a small study table. The usage of
                    glass is quite prominent and adds a touch of class along with long white drapes that open to the
                    view of the green, private garden and sit-out. We loved how the garden and sit-out have been
                    carefully integrated into the villa, proving much need private space that is absent in most resorts
                    in Gokarna.A passageway up the stairs takes you to another big sit-out that is great for yoga,
                    meditation, and for enjoying the cool ocean breeze. The yoga deck on the first floor and the private
                    courtyard garden area where we spent most of our time! The villas give you your own personal
                    sanctuary full of tranquillity and the view of a beautiful manmade pool in front of the sit-out.
