                <h2><strong>History of Shiva Caves</strong></h2>
                <p>The cave contains a Shiva Lingam surrounded by stunning scenery. It is believed there was a rivalry
                    among
                    the Trimurtis before the Cosmos was formed. The creator was to be the Tapasvi, followed by the
                    preserver
                    and then the destroyer. At the time, neither land nor water had been created. After intense tapasya,
                    Brahma and Vishnu emerged a hundred years later.</p>
                <p>Maheshwar had not yet returned to Tapasya. They waited a long time before beginning to create the
                    cosmos.
                    Eventually, Lord Shiva was confined on Earth. He then appeared, harnessing his third eye's
                    abilities.
                    Thus, the cave-like edifice was discovered when emerging from the dirt.</p>
                <p>After doing penance at Mount Kailash and reciting a self-written Shiva-tandava-stotram, Ravana, the
                    demon-king of Lanka got the Atma linga from Shiva. Shiva told Ravana that the holy Atma linga should
                    never be set on the ground because it would take root wherever it was placed.</p>
                <p>As Ravana neared Gokarna, Vishnu veiled the sunlight with his Sudarshana Chakra, knowing that Ravana
                    was
                    prompt in executing his daily rituals (Sandyavandhana- Wheel). Ravana paused at Gokarna for his
                    evening
                    prayers.

                    Because he had to be careful with the Atma linga, he wondered what to do. He spotted a Brahmin lad
                    (in
                    disguise as Lord Ganesha) and ordered him to carry the Atma linga in his hands till he returned
                    after
                    the procedures were completed. Lord Ganesha consented to keep the linga solely on a single
                    condition: he
                    would be doing so till he could handle the weight of the linga and then summon Ravana 3 times, and
                    if he
                    did not appear before, he would cast the linga on the ground.</p>
                <p>When Ravana was executing his ceremonies, Lord Ganesha hurriedly summoned him three times, laid the
                    linga
                    on the soil, and fled. The Atma linga became firmly embedded in the soil almost immediately. Ravana
                    realized that the Gods had deceived him.

                    Ravana attempted to free it, resulting in the Linga's covers being thrown to the temples of
                    Surathkal,
                    Dhareshwar, Gunavanteshwar, Murudeshwar, and Shejjeshwar; however, the Gokarna Lingam did not budge.
                    It
                    just twisted into the appearance of a cow's ear.

                    And this is how the Shiva Caves and Mahabaleshwar Temple came into existence. </p>

                <h2><strong>Jatayu Tirth near Shiva Caves</strong></h2>
                <p>The cliff nestled between Gokarna and Kudle beaches is ideal for viewing the sunset and soaking in
                    the beautiful sea views and the stones below. It is not particularly popular yet because getting
                    here requires effort, and only a few people manage to find it. You can reach the tirth via Kudle
                    beach or via a route near the Rama Tirtha temple.

                    It is also possible to hike down to the rocky coastline beneath, where a small stream flows into the
                    sea. Legend says it is the same place where Ravana killed Jatayu in Ramayana.</p>
                <p>A gentle incline continues down to the blue ocean, surrounded by fluffy white foam. If you chance
                    upon this hidden gem, you will be astounded by its beauty. With no one nearby, white foamy waves
                    smash on the cliffs below, giving you a glimpse of the roar of the waves, the air, the fragrance of
                    the sea, and the setting sun.</p>
