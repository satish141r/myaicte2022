                <p>The Mahabaleshwar Temple, Gokarna is a 4th-century CE Hindu temple located in Gokarna, Uttara Kannada
                    district, Karnataka state, India which is built in the classical Dravidian architectural style. It
                    is a site of religious pilgrimage. The temple faces the Gokarna beach on the Arabian Sea in which
                    Hindu pilgrims cleanse before visiting the temple for worship.</p>

                <p> The temple's first construction was by the king Mayurasharma of the Kadamba dynasty (reign 345 CE –
                    365 CE). Again, legend holds that Mayurasharma wished to learn of the Vedic rites and the Ashwamedha
                    Yagna (ritual of horse sacrifice). He travelled to Kanchipuram, a major religious learning centre,
                    but there, he was insulted by a horseman guard. He was angered and swore to defeat the ruling
                    Pallava dynasty. Following his defeat of the Pallavas, the king asked some priests to perform a
                    daily yajna to maintain his suzerainty over the region. Mayurasharma's son, King Kangavarma brought
                    Brahmin families from different lineages to maintain administration at the temple.</p>

                    gold.

                <h2><strong>Religious Practice</strong></h2>
                <p>The religious practices observed by most devotees, who are accompanied by their priests, consist of
                    shaving their head, fasting and then taking a bath in the Arabian Sea, opposite the temple. They
                    then pay obeisance to Lord Ganesha (the elephant headed god) deified in the Shri Maha Ganapathi
                    temple, which is a few yards away from the Mahabaleshwar temple. After observing these religious
                    procedures, devotees visit the main shrine of Mahabaleshwar for the Darśana (the auspicious sight of
                    a deity). The idol is placed inside a pit on the floor. The devotees can touch the idol and do the
                    puja by themselves. This is in contrary to other temples where the devotees are neither allowed to
                    touch the idol nor do puja.</p>

                <p>The Shivaratri festival, the observance of the union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati is celebrated
                    in Gokarna on the 14th day of the dark fortnight in the month of Magha, coming either in February or
                    March, when a very large number of pilgrims visit the shrine. During the festival, a Rath Yatra (a
                    procession in a large wooden chariot) is held. Images of Shiva and other deities are installed in a
                    chariot which is ceremoniously pulled through the town by the devotees, accompanied by drum bands.
                    The Ratha Yatra starts from the Shri Maha Ganapati temple at the terminus of the main market street,

                    Sea near to the temple, gayatri teertha are some important places where the events related to temple
                    takes place. Kotitheertha is a man-made pond, which is used for the immersion of idols and ritual
                    bathing. It is surrounded by temples and has small platform in the centre. Devotees usually take
                    bath in the pond before they visit the Mahabaleshwar Temple for worship.</p>

                    Located just few kilometres away from Mahabaleshwar Temple, Maha Ganapati Temple is a renowned
                    shrine with a 1.3 metre high black stone idol of Lord Ganesha. This temple is usually visited before
                    heading to the main Mahabaleshwar Temple.

                    It was built in honour of Lord Ganesha for succeeding to take away the Atma Linga from Ravana. The
                    architecture in this temple is something magnificent to witness. If you are looking for some
                    peaceful time in a tranquil space then this temple is a must visit.

                <p>According to Indian mythology, when Ravana, in his second attempt, was returning from Mount
                    Kailasa to Lanka carrying the prized possession of an Atmalinga, his route crossed Gokarna.
                    Ceasing the opportunity, the gods hatched a plot against Ravana as they did not want him to
                    finish the journey. They sent Lord Ganesha, who took the avatar of a young monk to deceive
                    Ravana and keep Atmalinga on the ground. As the condition was that wherever Atmalinga is
                    lowered and kept on the ground first, that place shall become its final place of worship.
                    For this feat of securing the Atmalinga in Gokarna (refer to Shree Venkataramana Temple for
                    details), Lord Ganesha is worshipped first and foremost and people visit this temple before
                    praying to the Atmalinga at the Mahabaleshwar Temple.

                    At the entrance of the temple, situated in the middle of a road, you can spot a few
                    barefooted Indian women selling flowers to earn their living. As you enter the precinct, a
                    railing separates the queues of people going in and coming out. Temple bells swing
                    carelessly overhead and its pealing sounds fill the premises. The statue of Lord Ganesha
                    faces west towards the Indian Ocean. You are guided to walk around the idol and as you
                    complete the pradakshina, a priest offers prasadam. This is relatively a small temple and,
                    with a moving queue, you would be in and out in less than 10 minutes. Here's a tip: don’t
                    forget to remove your socks too, as they’re considered part of footwear. The authorities
                    here are strict about following procedures to the hilt. </p>

                <h2><strong>Bhadrakali Temple</strong></h2>
                <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Awga4XpjtEvvW9rh9"

                <p>
                    The Bhadrakali temple was built in honor of Goddess Uma who turned into Mother Kali. Her incarnation
                    as the fierce and brutal is worshipped here with much devotion because she is considered as the
                    protector of the silent town of Gokarna. The presence of the Bhadrakali temple is considered to be a
                    significant part of the town primarily because of the various tales attached to the formation of the
                    temple. It is surely one of the strongest identities of Gokarna.

                    The temple is a part of the MAHABALESHWAR complex and is located about 1 km away from Gokarna. Over
                    the years Bhadrakali Temple has gained the position of a temple where people plan and go because
                    people believe that mother Kali listens to all. The temple is a humble built structure and its
                    entrance has 2 ferocious lions and two warriors on either side of the main gate.

                    The statue of the Goddess depicts Kali in a livid mode with huge eyes staring out in anger and with
                    weapons in one hand. Mythological beliefs point out that the main reason for the existence of the
                    temple was because Goddess Uma was discarded by Ravana and Lord Vishnu instructed her to remain
                    indoors. This later took the form of a temple.

                    The commercial town centre and the popular Shree Narayana temple are located within the vicinity of
                    the temple. Friday, as we all know, is the day of all Goddesses and this day holds special
                    importance here. Devotees from all over the world come here to pay respects, offer flowers and
                    Prasad along with doing puja for their overall well-being. The temple has an imposing presence and
                    due to the tales attached to the presence of the temple, it has been an important place of worship.

                <p>According to Indian mythology, the legendary Shatashrunga Mountain in the Himalayas was the abode of
                    Brahma, just as Mount Kailasa was to Shiva. Shatashrunga had two crore (koti) teerthas
                    (pilgrimages). Garuda, the mythical bird, once lifted and flew with the mountain. When Lord Brahma
                    realized this, he forced Garuda to place it down to earth. Garuda relieved itself of the weight by
                    placing the mountain partially in the ocean. In doing so, one crore teerthas got immersed in the
                    water while the remaining kotiteertha is on land at Gokarna. Some devotees prefer to take a dip in
                    this pond before proceeding to visit the temples.

                    About six acres in area, the rectangular Kotiteertha is flanked by colourful temples, monasteries
                    and residences on narrow lanes around it. Taller than the buildings, leaves of coconut and other
                    trees touch the blue sky and provide a green hue to the pond. From three sides of its walled
                    periphery, you could climb down to the water level where Hindu priests and monks sitting on a
                    platform under a shed conduct rituals. On the shorter western end, a few lotus leaves decorate the
                    water body. When the sand remains settled, you could see the long lotus stems in the clear lake. The
                    centre of the holy pond hosts a small Shiva lingam and a tall lamp post to illuminate the evenings.
                    Kotiteertha is also used for immersion of idols. </p>
